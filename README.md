# Random Password Generator

# Description

This webpage is a random password generator created to help users make a unique secure password. When on the webpage, the user has to click on the “generate password” button to initiate prompts. The first prompt will ask how many characters you would like in the password, one requirement is that the password must be a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters. If the user inputs a number less than 8 or more than 128, an alert will appear and ask for it to be re-entered. The following prompts will ask if the user wants to use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their password. Once all prompts are answered a password will be generated.
